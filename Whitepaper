{what is safetoken?}

Safe token is a cryptocurrency that aims to  help solve the modern issues with the safety of transactions, and the privacy across the network . 
This token revolves itself around its users, the more people use it the more safe token  will spread and secure everyones transactions. 
It uses wsl.trust which is a data base that stores transactions and hard codes a password randomly generated. these passcodes are very hard for someone to crack and gain access to the users funds. 
Wsl.trust will help make sure that not only safe token transactions are secure but that all transactions from other currencys are secure.



{Uniqueness}

Like every coin on the market today, safe token has instant transactions, we aim for transactions to not take longer than a day. Safe token was made for fun, I had no intention that this coin will go anywhere. But thanks to donators  i feel that this coin will solve many problems we face in todays modern society. This token will provide safety among all transactions that either are failed or sucessfull.
