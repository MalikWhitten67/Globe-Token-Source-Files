Safe token whitepaper

This introductory paper was originally published in 2021 by Trey Osagma, the founder of Safe Token

{what is safe token?}
Safe token is a cryptocurrency that aims to help solve the modern issues with the safety of transactions,
and the privacy across the network.  This token revolves itself around its users, 
the more people use it the safer token will spread and secure everyone’s transactions.  
It uses wsl.trust which is a data base that stores transactions and hard codes a password randomly generated. 
these passcodes are very hard for someone to crack and gain access to the user’s funds. 
Wsl.trust will help make sure that not only safe token transactions are secure but that all transactions from other currencies are secure.

{Uniqueness} 
Like every coin on the market today, safe token has instant transactions, 
we aim for transactions to not take longer than a day. Safe token was made for fun,
I had no intention that this coin will go anywhere.


{Features of Lux2 aglo}
The lux2 algo is an algorithm based on hard coded passwords.  
Wsl.trust generates a random number between 1 -150 and then regenerates backwards 510 – 1m, so for example if I were to make a transaction wsl.trust will find it and generate a random code like "1.8.7d.3t.24r" which if you look
at it the last 3 numbers have a letter so if to crack the password  I will take the numbers with a letter and put them first like this d7-t3-424-18 lux2, it is just numbers and letters written backwards.
But its not always that
easy see every time you get it right it regenerates a new letter and adds 6 more characters to the passcode.
